# How to use that script :arrow_down:

```
git clone https://github.com/magzu/Proton-Wma-buildscript.git
cd Proton-Wma-buildscript
bash Faudio-WMA
```

Let it run its course then a pop up window will ask you to select your proton install dir. <br>
you should find that folder inside of your steamlibrary/steamapps/common/ either in a seperate folder or from your home folder.
